# Privacy Policy (YA Flashcards)

Last updated: 2026-02-05

This Privacy Policy explains how YA Flashcards (“the App”) collects, uses, stores, and shares information. The App is designed for personal and family use.

## Summary (plain language)
- Your flashcard decks and cards are stored on your device and synced with **Apple iCloud** so they can appear on your devices signed in to your Apple ID.
- The App does **not** use advertising, does **not** use third-party analytics SDKs, and does **not** track you across apps or websites.
- The App includes an optional **in-app feedback** feature. If you submit feedback, it is sent to a Google Sheet controlled by the developer.
- Feedback can be anonymous. If you choose to provide an email address, it will be included with your feedback.

## Information the App collects

### 1) User content (decks and cards)
**What:** Deck titles, card questions and answers, and related metadata (for example creation and update dates).  
**Why:** To let you create and study flashcards, and to sync your content across your devices.  
**Where stored:** On your device and in your Apple iCloud account.  
**Shared with:** Apple (iCloud).

### 2) Study/session data
**What:** Temporary in-app state used while studying (for example session order and progress).

## What the App does NOT collect
- No advertising identifier (IDFA).

- No location data.
- No contacts, photos, microphone recordings, or camera data.
- No payment or financial information.

## How your data is stored and transmitted

### iCloud sync (Apple)
User content is stored locally on your device and synced using Apple iCloud. This sync is associated with your Apple ID. The developer does not operate their own backend for storing your flashcard content.

### Feedback (Google Sheets via Google Apps Script)
When you submit feedback, the App sends your feedback data over the network to a Google Apps Script web endpoint, which writes the submission to a Google Sheet. This feature is optional.

## Third-party services
The App uses:
- **Apple iCloud** (storage and syncing of your flashcard content)
- **Google Sheets / Google Apps Script** (optional feedback collection and storage)

The App does not integrate advertising networks or third-party analytics SDKs.

## On-device text to speech
For Sight Words study, the App can speak words using Apple’s on-device text-to-speech. This happens on your device and does not require sending the word to a cloud speech service.

## Data sharing
The App does not sell your data. Data is shared only as needed to provide the services described above (iCloud syncing and optional feedback storage).

## Data retention
- **Flashcard content:** Stored in iCloud and on your device until you delete it.
- **Feedback submissions:** Stored in the developer’s Google Sheet until deleted by the developer.

## Your choices and controls
- You can delete decks and cards in the App (this removes them from your synced content).
- Feedback submission is optional. You can submit feedback without providing an email address.

## Children’s privacy
The App is intended for general audiences and family use. The App does not knowingly collect personal information from children other than content entered into decks/cards and any feedback message voluntarily submitted.
